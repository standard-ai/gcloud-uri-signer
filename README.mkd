This is a basic authentication proxy for google storage

This tool was primarily implemented in order to use it with Nix â€“ thus enabling nix substituters in
google cloud storage buckets.

In contrast to [tweag/nix-store-gcs-proxy](https://github.com/tweag/nix-store-gcs-proxy) this tool
does not actually proxy the data and instead redirects clients to signed googleapis URLs. As a
consequence this tool is extremely lightweight and removes most of the intermediate overhead. The
downside is that this tool necessarily needs a well scoped service account to operate as it exposes
all the buckets accessible by the service key in question.

A typical use of this program would be to run it on a Google Cloud Run or some such like this:

```
gcloud-uri-signer --put --post -c $(echo -n ':banana' | sha256sum | cut -f1 -d' ')
```

Other tools that for instance utilize netrc then could access it as such:

```
$ cat netrc
machine gcloud-uri-signer.corp.com password banana
$ nix copy --to 'http://gcloud-uri-signer.corp.com:8000/bucket/' /nix/store/some-output --option netrc-file netrc
# just works
```
